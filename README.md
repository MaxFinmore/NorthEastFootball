Project Overview:
This is a website which talks about 3 major teams in the north-east of England and their past achievements as well as a football simulator which I have hosted using InfinityFree. The site is used to show how I am able to create a public website which can be accessed throughout any device.

Proof:
Included inside of my word document is screenshots showing the website working in both  normal web browser and inside of an incognito web browser.

Technologies which i used for this site are:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
PHP
InfinityFree free hosting
Potential SSL certificate if installed at a later time

JavaScript:
So i could include some JavaScript inside of my information-based website i had added a small interactive game on the bottom of the website where you can pick a corner of a goal to shoot at and the goalkeeper will randomly dive to a side. Depending on the outcome of your shot it will display either "Goal" or "Save" underneath.
